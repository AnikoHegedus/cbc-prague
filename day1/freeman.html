<h2>Biography</h2>

    <p class="red">
        <s>With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor</s>, <i>this ever popular American actor</i> has grown into one of
        the most respected figures in modern US cinema.
        <u>Morgan was born on June 1, 1937</u> <small>in Memphis, Tennessee</small>, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and
        Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended <code>Los Angeles City College</code> before serving
        several years in the <samp> Air Force</samp> as a mechanic between <a href="#">1955 and 1959</a>. His first dramatic
        arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical
        <strong>Hello, Dolly!</strong>.
    </p>

<p class="green">
    Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including "Easy Reader", "Mel Mounds" and "Count Dracula" on the
    Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show
    <span style="color: darkred" , class="seen">The Electric Company (1971)</span>. He then moved into feature film with
    another children's adventure, Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade
    (1973); then he played Casca in
    <span class="unseen">Julius Caesar (1979)</span> and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in
    for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas <span>Attica (1980)</span> and <span>Brubaker (1980)</span>,
    Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the
    1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However,
    he really stood out, scoring an <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscar</a> nomination as a merciless hoodlum
    in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscar</a>    nomination in the film version of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097239/" target="movies">Driving Miss Daisy</a>    (1989) opposite
    <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788/">Jessica Tandy</a>. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew
    Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama <a href="pages/glory.html">Glory (1989)</a> about freed
    slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.
